Hello, my name is Mike! 

I have been working with cloud technologies, particularly AWS, since 2014, and was one of the first people in the world to become AWS certified.

Through both online and face-to-face training, I have had the enormous privilege of helping thousands of people all around the world discover AWS, learn AWS and pass AWS certifications.
