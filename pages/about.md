Hello, my name is Mike! 

I have been working with cloud technologies, particularly AWS, since 2014, and was one of the first people in the world to become AWS certified.

Through both online and face-to-face training, I have had the enormous privilege of helping thousands of people all around the world discover AWS, learn AWS and pass AWS certifications.

I am extremely proud to be a Training Architect at [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com).   Linux Academy provide exceptional high quality and up-to-date training on all the major cloud providers, and compute technologies.
